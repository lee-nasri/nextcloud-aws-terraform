## How to use

First, you must set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
To set these variables on Linux, macOS, or Unix, use :

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
```

To set these variables on Windows, use :

```bash
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
```

After that, you can start terraform by running this following command.

```bash
terraform init
```
```bash
terraform plan
```
```bash
terraform apply
```
